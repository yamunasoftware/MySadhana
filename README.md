## Information

MySadhana is very simple app to use, to allow for maximum productivity! Just create and account or log in with your code and begin working! This app is also cross-platform and can run on any operating system and any browser!

## Usage

The navigation bar on the left of the screen is the main point of operation with the app. The "New" button creates a new note, the "Update" button allows you to reset the dashboard, the "Copy" button copies your login code, the "Enable" button allows you to enable push notification for your device, the "Exit" button logs you out of your current device, and the "Close" button opens a dialogue for you to fully close your MySadhana account.

Note titles are set as the text in the first line of the note. So, when you finish titling your note, you should enter into a different line, so that your note title is more readable in the dashboard. Furthermore, you should abstain from using long titles as it will make the reading experience worse and it will not help you decipher the contents of the note itself any better.

In the dashboard, you can see a search bar that allows you to search for the things that you want to find in your notes. Just type into the search field and the app will automatically search for you. Also, you can see your notes displayed below the search area, which allows you to open, pin, and delete different notes. When deleting a note, a dialogue will pop up underneath the search area, which asks you to confirm the deletion. To rearrange your notes in your dashboard, simple use the pin button in the order of which you want the notes to appear.

After changing the order or deleting notes in your dashboard, on one device, you should reload the app if the app is open on another device. This will ensure that no data is incorrectly synced, stored, or displayed on your app at all times.
